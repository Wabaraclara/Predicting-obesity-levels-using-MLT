Predicting Obesity levels using Machine learning techniques
In recent decades, there has been an alarming increase in obesity, a complex health issue that affects people everywhere. Even though lifestyle factors are major contributors to its growth, it is nevertheless difficult to diagnose obesity at an early phase. The primary aim of this study is to predict obesity levels by using machine learning techniques for physical characteristics and eating habits.Â The study trains and assesses machine learning models using a dataset that includes a variety of demographic, nutritional, and lifestyle characteristics. To predict obesity levels, three machine learning algorithms are used: Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Performance criteria including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F1 score are used to assess the models. The outcomes demonstrate how well machine learning techniques may predict obesity levels, with Random Forest performing better than the other models assessed.
